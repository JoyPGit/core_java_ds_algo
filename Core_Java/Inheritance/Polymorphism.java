// Polymorphism
/**
 * 
 * https://java2blog.com/polymorphism-java-example/
 * 
 * Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. 
 * The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used 
 * to refer to a child class object.
 * 
 * 
 * There are two types of polymorphism in java.
 * 
 * Compile time polymorphism.
 * Run time polymorphism.
 * 
 * Compile time Polymorphism
 * Compile time Polymorphism is nothing but method overloading in java. 
 * You can define various methods with same name but different method arguments
 * 
 * 
 * Runtime Polymorphism is nothing but method overriding in java.
 * If subclass has same method as base class then it is known as method overriding.
 * 
 * 
 * JVM decides at runtime which method it needs to call depending on the object assignment. 
 * Thatâ€™s why this is known as Run time polymorphism.
