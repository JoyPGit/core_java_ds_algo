ClassNotFound vs NoClassDefFound

ClassNotFoundException is a checked exception which occurs when an application tries to load a class through its fully-qualified name and can not find its definition on the classpath.


NoClassDefFoundError is a fatal error. It occurs when JVM can not find the definition of the class while trying to:

1 Instantiate a class by using the new keyword
2 Load a class with a method call
The error occurs when a compiler could successfully compile the class, but Java runtime could not locate the class file. It usually happens when there is an exception while executing a static block or initializing static fields of the class, so class initialization fails.



Difference between Exception and Error in Java

NullPointerException -> recoverable

Exceptions and errors both are subclasses of Throwable class. The error indicates a problem 
that mainly occurs due to the lack of system resources and our application should not catch 
these types of problems.
Some of the examples of errors are system crash error and out of memory error.

Exceptions are the problems which can occur at runtime and compile time. It mainly occurs in the 
code written by the developers.  Exceptions are divided into two categories such as checked exceptions 
and unchecked exceptions.

Error belongs to java.lang.error Package 
java.lang.Exception 


Example
OutOfMemoryError ,IOError 
NullPointerException , SqlException 

divide by zero error; java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero

exception can be caught and system can recover but Error causes the system to shut down.
finally won't run in case of error
