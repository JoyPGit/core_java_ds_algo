System.out.println is a Java statement that prints the argument passed, into the 
System.out which is generally stdout.

System – is a final class in java.lang package. As per javadoc, 
“…Among the facilities provided by the System class are standard input, standard output, and error 
output streams; access to externally defined properties and environment variables; 
a means of loading files and libraries; and a utility method for quickly copying a portion of an array…“

out – is a static member field of System class and is of type PrintStream. Its access specifiers are 
public final. This gets instantiated during startup and gets mapped with standard output console of 
the host. This stream is open by itself immediately after its instantiation and ready to accept data.

println – is a method of PrintStream class. println prints the argument passed to the standard 
console and a newline. There are multiple println methods with different arguments (overloading). 
Every println makes a call to print method and adds a newline. print calls write() and the 
story goes on like that.
