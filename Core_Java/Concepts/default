What Is a Default Method and When Do We Use It?
A default method is a method with an implementation, which can be found in an interface.

We can use a default method to add a new functionality to an interface, while maintaining backward compatibility with classes that are already implementing the interface:

public interface Vehicle {
    public void move();
    default void hoot() {
        System.out.println("peep!");
    }
}
Usually when we add a new abstract method to an interface, all implementing classes will break until they implement the new abstract method. In Java 8, this problem was solved by using the default method.

For example, the Collection interface does not have a forEach method declaration. Thus adding such a method would simply break the whole collections API.
