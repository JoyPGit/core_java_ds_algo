Runtime Polymorphism in Java. 
Runtime polymorphism or Dynamic Method Dispatch is a process in which a call to an overridden 
method is resolved at runtime rather than compile-time.

Type erasure can be explained as the process of enforcing type constraints only at compile time 
and discarding the element type information at runtime.

Type erasure can occur at class (or variable) and method levels.

At the class level, the compiler discards the type parameters on the class and 
replaces them with its first bound, or Object if the type parameter is unbound.

Class type erasure
public class Stack<E> {
    private E[] stackContent;

    public Stack(int capacity) {
        this.stackContent = (E[]) new Object[capacity];
    }
}
Upon compilation, the compiler replaces the unbound type parameter E with Object:

public class Stack {
    private Object[] stackContent;

    public Stack(int capacity) {
        this.stackContent = (Object[]) new Object[capacity];
    }
}

Method type erasure

public static <E> void printArray(E[] array) {
    for (E element : array) {
        System.out.printf("%s ", element);
    }
}
Upon compilation, the compiler replaces the type parameter E with Object:

public static void printArray(Object[] array) {
    for (Object element : array) {
        System.out.printf("%s ", element);
    }
}
