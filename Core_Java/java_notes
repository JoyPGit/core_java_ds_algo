JIT

access specifiers, static method
final
public vs private vs protectedvs default
private -> only itself
protected -> only subclasses
default -> visible in same package

abstraction vs encapsulation

abstraction hides unwanted data, 
encapsulation hides implementation of useful data
We can implement abstraction using abstract class and interfaces.	

Whereas encapsulation can be implemented using by access modifiers 
i.e. private, protected and public.

polymorphism -> Animal animal = new Dog();

method overriding vs overloading
same class vs subclass


interface vs abstract class

abstract method
The method which has only the declaration and not the implementation is called the abstract method and it has the keyword called “abstract”. Declarations ends with a semicolon.

multiple inheritance 


Difference between String, String Builder, and String Buffer.
Buffer is thread safe, Builder is not


Exception handling
final vs static

threads, 
Runnable, join, yield
start vs run
start() creates a new thread and 
the code inside the run () method is executed in the new thread. 

sleep()


public class MultipleThreads implements Runnable{
    // Main thread starts here
    public static void main (String[] args){
        Runnable r = new runnable ();
        Thread t=new thread ();
        //User thread starts here
        t.start ();
        Addition add = new addition ();
    }

    public void run(){
        go();  // User thread ends here
    }
}

If we need our class to extend some other classes other than the thread
then we can go with the runnable interface because in java 
we can extend only one class.

yield() vs run()
A yield () method moves the currently running thread to a runnable state 
and allows the other threads for execution. So that eq
ual priority threads have a chance to run. It is a static method. 
It doesn’t release any lock.



Locks are per objects. Every Java object has a lock. 
A lock has only one key. A thread can access a synchronized method only if
the thread can get the key to the objects to lock.
Synchronization makes only one thread to access a block of code at a time.
