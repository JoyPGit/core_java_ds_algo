Design
Design a custom Iterator in Java, which will have same methods like hashNext() and next(), 
but the user will be able to provide the starting index(m) from which the iteration will start and
then once it reaches the end, it will start from beginning index (0th index) and print till 
(m-1)th index. After that asked to write whole code for the class.
