1 TCP/IP MODEL VS OSI MODEL
OSI MODEL IS KIND OF LIKE A GUIDELINE,
BUT IN REAL WORLD TCP/IP IS USED
TCP -> Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol

2 OSI has 7 layers
Application, Presentation, Session
Transport
Network
Link
Physical

3 TCP/IP has 5 layers, the Application layer of TCP/IP incorporates
the application, presentation and session into a single application layer

4 BASIC WORKING :

Why port no?
Many applications can be running on a server. To map to a particular app,
source and destination ports are needed. Source port is my app's port 
and destination is the application on server which will handle the request.

Suppose I open a chrome browser window in my system
The application is assigned some port no (b/w 1024 and 65535). Then when 
I hit google, port no 80 (HTTP) on the Google server will handle my HTTP
request. 
src port () -> destination port (80)

Google's server can have multiple apps running, but port 80 will 
be the one handling HTTP requests.
Supose File Server is there, it will be running on port 21.

Similarly when I create a local server and assign a port no, it is the 
application layer port no. It is the destination port for 
any request made to my local server.

5 LAYERS:

Link Layer MAC address,
Network layer IP address
Trans Layer port to port 


Each layer adds certain amount of data to the previous layer's data and 
passes it down.


4.1 Application layer : HTTP, HTTPs, SMTP, FTP
4.2 Network layer : 

Transport Layer :

Port to port delivery 
Protocols: TCP, UDP
TCP is reliable, see TCP HEADER below


Network Layer :
System to sytem transmission
source machine to nearest router; nearest router to destination m/c
uses IP Address

Data Link Layer :

Hop to hop transmission or router to router transmission
Data Link Layer only ensures packets reach correct network, 

MAC address(Physical address)
Cyclic Redundancy Check
Error Control : CRC
Flow Control techniques : Stop and Wait, Go Back N, Selective Repeat
Access Control (ALOHA, )

TCP Protocol
Byte Streaming, Network layer
Sender sends the segment and receiver sends an acknowledgment, the ack number
is one more than the last byte no in the segment.

Various flags like URG(urgent), PSH(push) are used.
SYN flag is sent when the connection is established for the first time
Window Size -> Sender window size

Piggybacking
When server sends the ack no and sequence no simultaneously, this signifies
that data has been received and the ack no sets the ack sequence for 
further requests.
