When a client hits a url for the first time, a html doc is sent from 
server, this html doc has header, body and footer. the whole angular code
is attached in the body. 
<router-outlet>

and then to optmize lazy loading is used, which calls a page only when 
a request is made, so initial rendering is faster.
