2 DB partitioning (Replication, Sharding)

connection pooling
write to master db, sync slave dbs

with Sharding, 
transactions are difficult
Joins are difficult
Shards are inflexible, you cant increase range
Use manager for hierarchical sharding

Application level
DB level

but in app level, there is tight coupling

The choice of shard key determines three important things:
The distribution of reads and writes. 
The size of your chunks.
The number of shards each query hits. ...
Hashed id. ...
Multi-tenant compound index.

Strategies :
Hashing : compute a hash key of the shard key's value
How to choose a shard key?
