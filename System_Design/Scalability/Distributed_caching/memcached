Memcached (pronounced variously mem-cash-dee or mem-cashed) 
is a general-purpose distributed memory-caching system. 
It is often used to speed up dynamic database-driven websites by 
caching data and objects in RAM to reduce the number of times an 
external data source (such as a database or API) must be read. 
Memcached is free and open-source software.

Memcached's APIs provide a very large hash table distributed 
across multiple machines. When the table is full, subsequent 
inserts cause older data to be purged in least recently used(LRU) order.
Applications using Memcached typically layer requests and 
additions into RAM before falling back on a slower backing store, 
such as a database.

Memcached has no internal mechanism to track misses which may happen. 
However, some third party utilities provide this functionality.

function get_foo(int userid)
    /* first try the cache */
    data = memcached_fetch("userrow:" + userid)
    if not data
        /* not found : request database */
        data = db_select("SELECT * FROM users WHERE userid = ?", userid)
        /* then store in cache until next get */
        memcached_add("userrow:" + userid, data)
    end

    return data
